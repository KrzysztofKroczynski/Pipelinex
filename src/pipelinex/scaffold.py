# {name}

Describe what this pipeline does in one or two sentences.

## Purpose

Who uses this pipeline and what problem it solves.

## Rules

- List any rules that apply to every step (tone, output format, citation requirements, etc.)
- "Never invent data — if something is missing, say so and stop."
- Keep each step's output focused; don't duplicate work from previous steps.

## Tools available

The built-in tools (read_file, write_file, write_state, web_search, http_request,
run_script, extract_json, template, dispatch_task, ask_human) are always available.
List any pipeline-level custom tools here so every step knows about them.
"""

_STEP_SKILL = """\
# {step_id}

One sentence describing what this step does and why it exists.

## Context

Describe which state keys this step needs. Be explicit — name the key and signal its importance.

"handoff" from the previous step is essential — read it before doing anything.
"documents" is essential — you'll process every entry.
"config" is useful — it sets parameters for this step.
"raw_responses" and "debug_log" are not needed, skip them.

## Task

Describe what to do — written as you'd explain it to a smart colleague.
Mention which tools to use and in what order.

Before finishing, leave a brief handoff note:
write_state(key="handoff", value="<one sentence: what was done and what the next step should know>")

## When things go wrong

- If a tool call fails once, retry with a corrected argument.
- If it fails twice, note the failure in state and continue with the remaining work.
- If the step cannot proceed at all, stop and write a clear error to state before exiting.

## Notes

Edge cases, known gotchas, or examples worth preserving here.
